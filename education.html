            This website is much overdo for an overhaul and it's currently being worked on. More information will be here soon!
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-green">Studies</h2>
          <p>
            I did my undergrad at Carleton University between 2012 and 2016 in Computer Science, Honours Robotics. My undergraduate
            thesis had me developing emergent narrative systems by enhancing NPC dialogue.
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm currently working on my masters in computer science, specifically focusing on computational creativity and data driven
              creativity assistants for game content creation. I intend to graduate by the end of 2018.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-blue">Teaching</h2>
          <p>
            I currently teach a summer course at Carleton University, <em>COMP4900: Intensive Game Development Project</em>. In this course,
            I teach game design, rapid prototyping, and give a hands approach to learning how to use agile and scrum methods in game development.
          </p>
          <p>
              Before instructing, I was a TA for many courses. In every course, my duties were primarily lecturing, hosting workshops, coordinating labs,
              and of course the occasional grading. 
              <ul>
                    <li><strong>COMP 1406: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>: I've TAd this course a number of times.
                    We taught basic software engineering, introduction to software design, and object oriented programming.</li>
                    <li><strong>COMP 1501: Introduction to Computer Game Design</strong>: I designed a new set of tutorials for this course
                    and ran some evaluations on the performance of them. The new format had me lecturing a little more and getting
                    students to learn game design concepts and put them to the test immediately in the labs.</li>
                    <li><strong>COMP 2404: Introduction to Software Engineering</strong>: Here I focused on running C++ labs.</li>
                    <li><strong>COMP 2801: Introduction to Mobile Autonomous Robotics</strong>: In this course, I hosted lectures to teach
                    students about the paradigms and patterns of designing autnomous agents. The course was workshop styled, so students
                    were lectured and then had to complete a robotics programming challenge by the end of the workshop.</li>
                    <li><strong>COMP 3004: Object Oriented Software Engineering</strong>: This course drops students into a pretty intensive group project.
                    My main focus with this was training the other TAs to use Qt, running quality and cohesion checks on TA grading,
                    and hosting lecture-style office hours to teach students about software engineering from a different perspective.</li>
                    <li><strong> COMP4107: Neural Networks</strong>: In this course, I primarily assisted students with the design and
                    implementation of various different neural networks.</li>
                </ul>

          <h2 class="text-red">So who am I?</h2>
          
          <p>
            I'm a developer in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. After an undergrad in computer science, I moved on to my master's where I'm researching computational creativity.
            I was originally from a small town in Southern Ontario called Strathroy. There, and at an even smaller school in an even smaller town just a few years before that,
            is where I got to teach my first students web applications.

          </p>
          <p>
            Mind you, I was in Grade 7, my students were staff from the across the school board, and this was right around the birth of <em>Web 2.0</em>. Up until that point
            it was websites in Neopets, choose your own adventure games in QBasic, and a few personal sites. The love for learning, teaching, and creation, led me start the 
            programming club in highschool and teach C++ for competition programming. There were also a number of adventure games, arcade games, poems, and hacking sims written along 
            the way! High school was a great time to learn some basic graphic design, video editing, and America's Army team tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bug wasn't fixed with highschool. Starting an undergrad at Carleton, I was elected into the Carleton Computer Science Society and spent four years
            running events, giving talks, interviewing for unviersity recruitment, and working as a teaching assistant. I started my research career in first year working on 
            multitouch web applications and user experience. I started teaching occasional lectures in my third year, and was hired on as a contract instructor in the first year 
            of my master's tasked with designing a new, hands on course on agile game development. I've done a little bit of consulting for startups, as well as spending a 
            summer as lead developer with a small team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I spend my days going to game development events, working on my thesis, designing games, and trying to keep up to date with interesting tech.
